We\u2019ve built technology that helps people find great therapists with the first software-enabled national network of providers accepting insurance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 in 4 people in the US have a treatable mental health condition, but the majority of providers don\u2019t accept insurance, making therapy too expensive for most people. Headway is building a new mental healthcare system that everyone can access by making it easy for therapists to accept insurance and scale their practice.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Headway was founded in 2019. Since then, we\u2019ve grown into a diverse, national network of over 60,000 mental healthcare providers across all 50 states who run their practice on our software and have served over 1 million patients. We\u2019re a Series D company with over $325m in funding from a16z (Andreessen Horowitz), Accel, GV (formerly Google Ventures), Spark Capital, Thrive Capital, Forerunner Ventures and Health Care Service Corporation.</p>\n<p>We want your time here to be the most meaningful experience of your career. <strong>Join us, and help change mental healthcare for the better.</strong></p></div>\n\n<h2><strong>About engineering at Headway</strong></h2>\n\n<p>Building a new mental healthcare system at Headway is only possible because of the scale and leverage that software can provide.&nbsp; The engineering team at Headway is a small but mighty team using technology to build that future (and have a fun time while doing it!).</p>\n\n<h3>Principles that guide us:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Focus on the mission</strong>: We view software as a means of affecting change in the world, not as an end unto itself. We write software to empower our patients and therapists to better solve the problems they\u2019re facing.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Ship small, learn fast</strong>: We are building new and novel products and believe that we learn what our users need by quickly shipping and iteration</li>\n<li><strong>Everything is a product</strong>: Whether it's our patient search experience or a developer productivity improvement, we treat everything we build at Headway as a product with end-users in mind.</li>\n<li><strong>Optimize for trust</strong>: We believe that engineers should be continually learning. To learn effectively and to be productive, engineers must feel safe asking questions and discussing mistakes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Tools we use:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Languages:</strong>&nbsp;Python 3, TypeScript</li>\n<li><strong>Libraries &amp; Frameworks:&nbsp;</strong>FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, React, Remix, Next.js</li>\n<li><strong>Datastores:&nbsp;</strong>Postgres, Redis</li>\n<li><strong>Infrastructure:&nbsp;</strong>AWS (Fargate, ECS, S3, and more), Spark and Kafka</li>\n<li><strong>Monitoring:</strong>&nbsp;Datadog, PagerDuty, Sentry</li>\n<li><strong>Version Control:</strong>&nbsp;Github, PagerDuty</li>\n<li><strong>Vulnerability Management</strong>: Snyk, Semgrep</li>\n<li><strong>Cloud Security:&nbsp;</strong>Lacework</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Projects we\u2019re working on:</h3>\n\n<p>There is a lot that we're building at Headway, but here are a few projects to give you an idea of the problems we're tackling.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Financial Processing and Bookkeeping: </strong>One way to think about Headway is that we help thousands of independent providers operate a small practice. Having detailed and accurate financial systems is critical to their success. Their livelihood depends on us and as their trusted partner, we take that seriously.</li>\n<li><strong>Claims Management and Insurance Processing:&nbsp;</strong>We make a guarantee to patients when they seek care that they will have a predictable cost with us. We make a guarantee with providers that they will have easy insurance operations. Meanwhile, Headway processes hundreds of thousands of claims monthly across all states, all major insurance networks and governmental programs. Our systems must be up to the task.</li>\n<li><strong>Internal Tooling Platform:</strong> In healthcare there is always a human component. Engineers build internal tools for multiple non-technical teams and need a scalable, quality platform to deliver them. This platform supports tools for our CX team who is interfacing directly with patients and providers, our ops team who is dealing with claims denials and escalations, and our medical team who is dealing with care quality.</li>\n<li><strong>Therapist practice management</strong>: Building a best-in-class platform for Headway therapists to manage their patients, appointments, payments, and more.</li>\n<li><strong>Patient search and matching</strong>: Transforming the therapist search experience and becoming the trusted guide for patients to find the right therapist.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><strong>Who you are</strong></h2>\n\n<p>We\u2019re looking for experienced engineers who have the ability to deal with ambiguity and learn new technologies and systems.&nbsp; Below are some additional experiences we think help engineers succeed at Headway.</p>\n\n<h3>For all engineers:</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You have experience working on systems that power businesses and support modern web applications.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Strong understanding of at least one programming language and comfortability with others</li>\n<li>Shaped work to achieve company and team goals</li>\n<li>Flexed into new technical and non-technical areas as projects require</li>\n<li>Committed team member supporting the growth of those around them</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3><strong>For Senior Engineers:</strong></h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Designed software architecture at the systems-level</li>\n<li>Led shaping of technical requirements, roadmaps, and strategy</li>\n<li>Led and mentored teams of engineers</li>\n<li>Evaluated new technologies and build vs. buy decisions</li>\n<li>Recruited, interviewed, and on-boarded engineers</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2><strong>Our interview process</strong></h2>\n\n<p>After you apply to Headway, here are some details of what to expect during the interview process.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Initial screen</strong>: You\u2019ll connect with someone in recruiting so you can learn more about the team, Headway\u2019s mission and exciting growth, and we can get a better idea of your background.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>First round</strong>: You'll meet with an engineer on the team to do some live coding and learn more about the engineering team.</li>\n<li><strong>Final rounds</strong>: You\u2019ll meet several more team members for technical and non-technical interviews and leave with a fuller picture of what it\u2019s like to work at Headway.</li>\n<li><strong>References and the Offer</strong>: Our favorite part of the process!

Within the Content Development team (CD), we implement strategies and develop capabilities to detect suspicious or malicious behavior on customer endpoint devices. Our goal is to enable the sensor to autonomously identify and stop the bad guys where possible, and to provide useful visibility and guidance to security analysts when new previously unknown adversary activity occurs. We research attacker behavior to understand their tools and techniques, and we build the capabilities to detect and prevent their malicious activity. Our detection strategies are often performed directly on the endpoint, but can also execute in the cloud, and may also utilize a hybrid approach combining aspects of both environments.  This ability to leverage a variety of tools across the CrowdStrike stack allow us to accomplish our detection goals while balancing local resource utilization and false positives for our customers.<br><br>As a sensor engineer within the CD team you will be focused on the analysis and development of detections for attack techniques across supported Windows OS versions. You'll work collaboratively to implement detection logic within the Falcon sensor which includes both user-mode and kernel-mode components that together observe system activity, recognize malicious behavior, provide on-box prevention and remediation capabilities, and send relevant security related telemetry to the Falcon Cloud. You'll help find creative and resourceful ways to detect Windows specific threats while also helping to develop cross platform features that leverage telemetry from common OS subsystems such as file system, memory, process, and network activity. You'll get exposure to both user-mode and kernel-mode coding practices.<br><br>As a Senior Engineer, you'll function as a key resource and subject matter expert for other engineers within the team and across the company.  You'll collaborate with a wide range of other teams as you drive your own initiatives and assist with other projects. You'll be expected to make significant contributions from the initial concept phase through design, implementation, release, and bugtail/support. We're looking for smart people who want to be challenged and take ownership of what they build.<br><br><b>What You'll Do</b>:<ul><li>Design and build detection logic and systems leveraged across teams within CrowdStrike to detect cyber attackers and stop breaches.</li><li>Extend our existing codebase and test suites utilizing C++, Python, and other tools as appropriate.</li><li>Brainstorm, define, and build collaboratively across multiple teams.</li><li>Build elegant, robust, and reliable solutions for complex technical problems.</li><li>Obsess about learning, and champion the newest technologies &amp; tricks with others, raising the technical IQ of the team.</li><li>Deliver and accept feedback with grace and courtesy.</li><li>Troubleshoot issues within the product when necessary, assisting customer support.</li><li>Leverage your understanding of engineering best practices, including topics like secure coding, testing paradigms, effective peer code reviews, logging, and resilient architecture patterns, to ensure that our code is clean.</li><li>Be an energetic 'self-starter' who is empowered to take ownership and be accountable for deliverables, both individually and when leading a team.</li></ul><b>What You'll Need:</b><ul><li>5+ years of experience with EITHER one of:<ul><li>Reverse engineering, threat detection, and malware analysis; and an interest in on-device development, or</li><li>Designing, building, and delivering high-quality software in C/C++ with an interest in security.</li></ul></li><li>Low-level OS knowledge of Windows operating system internals, components, APIs, and design.</li><li>Team player - able to lead, mentor, communicate, collaborate, and work effectively in a globally distributed team.</li></ul><b>Bonus Points:</b><ul><li>Prior security experience, particularly in exploit and vulnerability analysis.</li><li>Prior experience working with low-level code, such as OS kernel, firmware or device drivers.</li><li>Understanding of kernel-mode and multi-threaded concurrent systems development in any of our supported platforms, with an interest to grow skills in all of them.</li><li>Prior development or testing experience with python.</li><li>Prior experience delivering software via agile processes.</li></ul>#LI-Remote<br><br>#LI-NT1<br><br>#HTF<br><br><b> Benefits of Working at CrowdStrike: </b><ul><li>Remote-friendly and flexible work culture</li><li> Market leader in compensation and equity awards</li><li> Comprehensive physical and mental wellness programs</li><li> Competitive vacation and holidays for recharge</li><li> Paid parental and adoption leaves</li><li> Professional development opportunities for all employees regardless of level or role</li><li> Employee Resource Groups, geographic neighbourhood groups and volunteer opportunities to build connections</li><li> Vibrant office culture with world class amenities</li><li> Great Place to Work Certified\u2122 across the globe</li></ul>CrowdStrike is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.
